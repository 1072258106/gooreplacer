WARNING

Now this addon can actually replace google link but in vain!
those google links still load!
I am struggling with [ContentPolocy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Reference/Interface/nsIContentPolicy) to solve it.

a firefox addon for replacing google link to speed page loading.

As every Chinese know, Google has been blocked, which causes some websites that refer google js and font load toooo slow.

so this addon is here.

Develop

This addon use [Mozilla SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK) for developing

Besides, I use [360 common lib](http://libs.useso.com/) to replace google links.
